This folder contains the mu data for several common elements in materials used in optics and filters.

All elements have data in .csv format (comma separated values, spreadsheet) and .pkl format (python pickling, serialized array)

Mu is a constant based on material and energy, the intensity of light that passes through a material of thickness t is
I=I0*e^(-mu t)

Xx is a test element, for all energies, mu=0 (perfect transmission)

Only elements are supported, no chemical compounds allowed
