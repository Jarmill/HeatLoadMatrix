head load modeling in high energy synchrotron sources

This software is used for predictive safety analysis. A table of power densities (W/m^3) will be generated by this program as a result of the user's beam and object parameters. This table can be bound to a model in ANSYS, which will show the steady-state temperatures. If the temperature of the model exceeds a safety threshold, then the design should be reevaluated.
